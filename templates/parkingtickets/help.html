<h2>Excuse me, but, er, what the hell is this?</h2>

<p>
You know sometimes the little things can really ruin your day. I'm not talking major life changing events, just little niggles that really wear you down. 
</p>
<p>
Like spilling coffee down your shirt. Like stubbing your toe. Or, like getting a parking ticket. 
</p>

This is a photo of all the speakers from this year's <a href="http://flashbelt.com">FlashBelt</a>, that's me there in the middle. It was while we were posing for this photo that we noticed that all the nearby cars had parking tickets. 
</p>
<h2> What's that got to do with anything?
</h2>
<p>
It made me sad that while we were all there having a happy time, there were some other people who would find some sadness upon returning to their car. So an idea struck us. Why not pay this guy's parking ticket? There were like 50 of us so we'd only have to put a dollar in each. 
</p>
<p>
I rallied round the speakers and quickly raised enough cash (including 5 euros and 5 British pounds) and put the money under the windscreen wiper with the ticket.

What ridiculous randomness; the initial disappointment of finding the ticket, followed by the confusion of seeing all of this money, with no explanation and no possible logical reason for being there. Wouldn't that cheer you up a little? 
</p>
<p>
The next day, I searched twitter for the term "parking ticket" to see if anyone had tweeted about this random act of generosity. Sadly I found no reference to what had happened. But what I did find was hundreds and hundreds of people who were all having a slightly shitty day. 
</p>
<p>
So I got together with my good friend Jamie and set up this website. I can't solve all the big problems in the world. But maybe, just maybe I can cheer someone up in some really small way with some pointless act of generosity. 
</p>
<h2>
So what can I do? 
</h2>
<p>
Go pack to the home page. You'll be shown a tweet from someone who has mentioned the term parking ticket. If they've got a parking ticket, and you feel sorry for them, show them some love by clicking on a heart. 
</p>
<p>
If they're just mentioning the words &quot;parking ticket&quot; then give them no love, they'll soon be filtered out of the system. 
</p>
<p>
Every month, I'll find all the highest rated tweets, and pick one. And then I'll pay their parking ticket for them. I may even @ reply some of the highest rated twitterers to let them know that you care.
</p>
<h2>
You'll pay their ticket? Are you some crazy rich nutter?
</h2>
<p>
No sadly not. Well not rich, but maybe crazy and a nutter. But I'm thinking once a month I can afford to pay someone's ticket. 
</p>
<h2>
You are mad but I kinda like this idea. What can I do to help? 
</h2>
<p>Please just use the site and vote for as many tweets as you can. Thank you!</p>
